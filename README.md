## Projects

1. Income Driven: Exploring Relationships Between Vehicles and Household Income in New York State

Personal vehicles are essential for both work and leisure, especially when public transportation is not readily available. However, vehicles also impose significant costs, in both purchase and upkeep, on their owners, and this burden is felt more for households/families in lower socioeconomic brackets. Using a combination of New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) vehicle registration data and demographic/economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this project seeks to explore trends in vehicle ownership as well as relationships between vehicles and socioeconomic indicators across geographic locations in New York State. This may reveal trends that guide further research and analysis directions about the state of vehicles in New York.
