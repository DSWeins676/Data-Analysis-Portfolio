# Scoffing the Law: New York State Enforcement Measures Applied to Vehicle Registrations

Author: Daniel Weinstein

Date: April 27th, 2025

## Objectives
Personal vehicles are essential for both work and leisure, especially when public transportation is not readily available. However, vehicles also impose significant costs, in both purchase and upkeep, on their owners, and this burden is felt more for households/families in lower socioeconomic brackets. Using a combination of New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) vehicle registration data and demographic/economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this project seeks to explore trends in vehicle ownership as well as relationships between vehicles and socioeconomic indicators across geographic locations in New York State. This may reveal trends that guide further research and analysis directions about the state of vehicles in New York.

## Data Source 
The main source for this analysis is the "Vehicle, Snowmobile, and Boat Registrations" dataset, available through New York Open Data (https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Vehicle-Snowmobile-and-Boat-Registrations/w4pv-hbkt/about_data). The New York State Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) requires registration of personal and commercial cars, trucks, boats, snowmobiles, and so on. The registration ties with other important aspects of vehicle ownership, such as insurance coverage and vehicle inspection status, to provide a regulatory mechanism to ensure the suitability of a vehicle for the road and to tie it to a particular owner in a particular state.

This dashboard was created using the "reg_pers" dataframe from my other project "Income Driven: Exploring Relationships Between Vehicles and Household Income in New York State. The steps for cleaning/filtering this data can be found in this [notebook](www.google.com).
